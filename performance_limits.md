# Performance Ceiling Discovery

## Results
- Max stable concurrent units: ~60
- First degradation point: ~90 units

## Performance Observations
- FPS ~70 at low unit counts
- FPS stabilizes around ~60 up to ~60 units
- FPS drops to ~40 beyond ~90 units
- Degradation is sustained after crossing the limit

## Notes
- No crashes observed
- Performance loss is primarily FPS-related
